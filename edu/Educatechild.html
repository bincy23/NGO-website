which you can use to change the world and the most effective way to break out 
of the cycle of poverty.<br> Yet, after 70 years 
of Independence, over two crore children 
(NSS-2014) still remain out-of-school 
in India. 
<br><i>These children are not only 
deprived of their right to receive an education 
but they lose their childhood 
to earn bread for a living.</h3>
